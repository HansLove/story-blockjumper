- A young urban warrior in his late 20s, with semi-long black hair tied in a loose ponytail. He has a clean-shaven, sharp face with Italian-American features, resembling a young Matt Dillon. His build is lean and toned, and he wears light tactical gear with street aesthetics. His eyes are fierce yet curious — the kind of protagonist born for chaos and clarity alike. Manga-style, high-contrast lighting, gritty background.
